Master's Thesis in optoelectronics and silicon photonics in the scope of the TIME Double Degree program between UCLouvain (Belgium) and Keio University (Japan).

__Tasks:__ Designing of an optical (de)multiplexer (arrayed waveguide grating), solving both for higher transmission performances and reducing the Si photonics drawbacks with respect to what is currently used in the industry.

Problem solving strategy: 
1. Historical review, state-of-the-art study and industry benchmarks
2. New improvements to the structure
3. Step-by-step optimization techniques design 
4. Data acquisition and full simulation
5. Overall characteristics computation and final results

In this context was used: 
* RSoft Photonic Device Tools for simulations of sensitive regions
* RSoft CAD environment for layout design
* Python for data processing and optimization
* Python for overall characteristics computations

__Framework:__ Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWG), also called PHASARS in the literature, are optical
communication devices which play a key role in Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM),
a technique considerably improving networks transmission capacity and flexibility. Taking
light as an input and by the successive use of Fourier Optics transformation as well as a
waveguide array, which provides the focusing and dispersive properties, the AWG are able to
operate as wavelength multiplexers, demultiplexers and routers.

__Issues:__ Firstly built in silica which resulted
in too bulky structures and with the advance of Si photonics technology, Si was therefore
used for the miniaturization of AWGs. This has permitted to reach dimensions of one or
two order of magnitude smaller. However, Si AWG’s waveguides (WGs) enhanced optical
confinement induces larger phase error and scattering/losses in transition regions. This is
typically resulting in deteriorated performances of crosstalk and insertion loss. The most
sensible region located at the abrupt transition, with a high index difference between Si and
SiO2, between the planar slab region and the arrayed WGs region, which yields to optical
field mismatch in addition to scattering.

__Action:__ At first, a physically defined topology being optimized by the shape, length as
well as choice of configuration, tested among several alternatives, for the transition tapers
and slab/waveguides etching. The field being generated by finite-difference time-domain
(FDTD). And then, the introduction of etching in the FPR (free propagation region) for
modification of the effective refractive index and decrease the impedance mismatch between
two regions in which the light successively travels. The metric used for optimization is mainly
the overlap integral although the normalized output power is sometime used. This overlap
function being mathematically chosen to represent the coupling efficiency from the slabs to
the WGs and inversely.

__Results:__ The study demonstrate improvements compared to simple transition
shapes usually used, evaluate the device overall performances and computed the final 
parameters values for an operating device.
